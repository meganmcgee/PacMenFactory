## Description

This project was an assignment through the MIT xPro Certificate in Coding program, in which I am currently enrolled. We were given some starter code and asked to complete the missing pieces to make it work properly. The goal was for all of the PacMen to move at random while staying within the browser screen. 

## How To Use

If you follow the link [PacMen Factory](http://meganmcgee.github.io/PacMenFactory) you will see an empty screen with two buttons. You can add unlimitted PacMen to the screen by clicking "Add PacMan". When you click the button "Start Game" they will begin to move accross the screen at random. The more you click "Start Game", the faster they move.

## Future Improvements

If I were going to make improvements to this project, I might try incorporate different images of PacMan that show him with his mouth open and closed, so as he's moving accross the screen it also looks like he's opening and closing his mouth.
